#
# This is the primary config file for Gyre
#
# It is strongly recommend that you do not edit any of the default files,
# but instead add your own files in custom or user_tweaks.yaml.
#
# (Nothing bad will happen if you edit the existing files, but future updates
# won't change any files you edited, to avoid deleting your edits)
#
# You can list configs directly here if you like, but in general it's better
# to break the configs up into smaller files in directories. This lets you add or
# tweak config and still get updates to the core configurations.
#
# See _documented.yaml for documentation on the structure
